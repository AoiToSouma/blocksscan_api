If these packages are not installed, this process will automatically install them.<br>
Secondly, check the current balance of wallet address and create the first record.<br>
The DB will be created in the "data" directory.<br>

# Wallet monitoring
```
pm2 BalanceCheck.sh
```
If there is a difference between the XRC20 token in the wallet and the previous value, it will be recorded in the DB.

# Output data to csv file

```
It can be loaded into a spreadsheet.
